Here you are gonna have multiples modules related to your gameplay. 
For now it's only Players as an example 

but other example coould be : 

```
Inputs 
Cameras
Mining
EnemiesLogic
EnemiesManagement
etc ... 
```

Whatever you see fit. 

Each module need to be their own assembly definition for clear separation of responsibility and to be able to see clearly what module depend on witch.

Clean code everyone ! If your module is too big or do too much , split it !
